    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chicken nugget is a food product consisting of a small piece of deboned chicken meat that is breaded or battered, then deep-fried or baked. Invented in the 1950s, chicken nuggets have become a very popular fast food restaurant item, as well as widely sold frozen for home use.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients </h2>

        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li> teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut chicken into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, thyme, and salt together well in a medium bowl. Put melted butter in a bowl or dish for dipping.</li>
